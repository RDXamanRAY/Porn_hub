        <h2>who is mia khalifa ?</h2>
        <p>Mia Khalifa is a Lebanese-American model, fashion blogger, and jewelry brand owner. Her life experience is colorful, and here is a detailed introduction to her: 

            Mia Khalifa's teenage years were like a reflection of an era. No matter the different skin tones, looks, or the glances of the people around her, they almost pushed her to the edge of society. This led to self-doubt and denial in her heart, which directly or indirectly led to her controversial past.
            
            In 2014, Mia Khalifa worked in the adult film industry for a period of time, partly due to her "low self-esteem" and the confusion in her heart. This experience made her better understand the adult film industry. "Young people in adult films are unconsciously accepting a standard set by middle-aged white men, which may be very unhealthy," Mia expressed her thoughts.
            
            Now, Mia Khalifa has transformed and become known as a fashion blogger. She is passionate about vintage shopping and has been invited to attend fashion shows and shoot style sheets for major fashion brands. With over 27 million followers on Instagram and over 5 million followers on Twitter, Mia has become a well-known figure in the fashion industry.
            
            In conclusion, Mia Khalifa is a controversial public figure whose experience and career have attracted much attention. Her beauty and sense of style have also made her a favorite of many fashion brands</p>

         <h2>Early life and education</h2>
         <p>Khalifa was born in Beirut, Lebanon[1] and raised Catholic in what she describes as a "very conservative" home.[5] She attended a French-language private school in Beirut, where she also learned to speak English.[5] Khalifa's family left their home in the wake of the South Lebanon conflict,[1][5] moving to the United States in 2001.[6]

            After moving to the United States, her family lived in Montgomery County, Maryland,[5][6] where she played lacrosse in high school.[7] She has said she was bullied at school for being "the darkest and weirdest girl there", which intensified after the September 11 attacks.[5]
            
            She attended Massanutten Military Academy in Woodstock, Virginia, and later graduated from the University of Texas at El Paso with a Bachelor of Arts in history.[5][8] She supported herself while there by working as a bartender, model, and "briefcase girl" on a local Deal or No Deal-esque Spanish game show</p>

         <h2>Career</h2>   
         <p>Khalifa entered the pornographic film industry in October 2014, after being recruited by a man who asked her if she was interested in nude modeling.[9][10] Her stage name was taken from the name of her dog, Mia, and American rapper Wiz Khalifa.[11]

            She came to widespread attention after the release of a scene from Bang Bros in which she wears a hijab during a threesome.[5] The scene brought Khalifa instant popularity, as well as criticism from writers and religious figures, and led to her parents publicly disowning her.[5][12] Alex Hawkins, vice president of marketing for xHamster, said, "The outrage it caused in the Arab world ended up being a bit of a 'Streisand effect'. Suddenly, everyone was searching for her. The effort to censor her only made her more ubiquitous."[5] With more than 1.5 million views, the 22-year-old Khalifa became the most searched-for performer on the adult video sharing website Pornhub.[2]
            
            On December 28, 2018, Pornhub revealed that she was the No. 1 ranked performer on their website.[4] After becoming the most searched-for actress on Pornhub, Khalifa received online death threats, including a manipulated image of Khalifa being held captive by an Islamic State executioner and a warning that she would be "the first person in Hellfire",[13] to which she jokingly replied, "I've been meaning to get a little tan recently."[14] Lebanese newspapers wrote articles critical of Khalifa, which she considered trivial due to other events in the region.[15]
            
            In an interview with The Washington Post, Khalifa said the controversial scene was satirical and should be taken as such, claiming that Hollywood films depicted Muslims in a far more negative light than any pornographer could.[14] Among those who publicly spoke out to defend her decision to become an adult performer was British-Lebanese author Nasri Atallah, who stated, "The moral indignation ... is wrong for two reasons. First and foremost, as a woman, she is free to do as she pleases with her body. As a sentient human being with agency, who lives halfway across the world, she is in charge of her own life and owes absolutely nothing to the country where she happened to be born."[1][4] Khalifa said, "Women's rights in Lebanon are a long way from being taken seriously if a Lebanese American porn star that no longer resides there can cause such an uproar. What I once boasted to people as being the most Westernized nation in the Middle East, I now see as devastatingly archaic and oppressed.</p>
