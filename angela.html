        <h2 style="color: rgb(124, 229, 232);">QUOTES </h2>
        <p style="color: rgb(124, 229, 232);">I saw porn for the first time at age 14 and from that point on I wanted to get into the industry. I had been slut-shamed for my sexuality in high school and the adult industry seemed like a space in which my sexuality would finally be celebrated. I waited until I was 18 years old and sent some nude photos to The Score Group in Miami, Florida. They showed interest in my natural curves straightaway and flew me to the States to begin shooting. I've never looked back.
            There is a lot of stigma attached to being a woman who embraces her sexuality regardless of whether or not she is in the adult industry. I was aware that there may be consequences of entering the adult industry. But I was also aware that there are consequences of not living an honest life, following your dreams, and indulging in your passions.
            I use my real name. It was a deliberate political move. I wanted the world to know that I was happy and proud to publicly share my sexuality. There is so much shame surrounding sex and sexuality and part of my life's mission is to help people feel confidant and comfortable about their sexual fantasies and desires.
            [on doing her first hardcore scene] It was such a rush. I had been waiting since I was 14 years old for that moment. The moment I walked onto set I knew I was doing the right thing.
            I do everything in my power to make sure I don't get anything because of my looks alone. In certain circumstances I will hide my body to make sure I'm taken seriously on an intellectual level. I covered my curves while I was at [The University of Melbourne]. I'm a multidimensional person, I'm independent, I take responsibility for my actions, and I get things done without resorting to my sexuality. The only time I really use my looks is when I'm modeling, and even then I'm expressing a feeling and living out a philosophy rather than just exposing my body.</p>
