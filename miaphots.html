    <p>Mia Khalifa (/miːə kəˈliːfə/; Arabic: ميا خليفة Miyа̄ Ḵalīfah [mijaː χaliːfa(h)]; born 1993[1]) is a Lebanese-American media personality and former pornographic film actress and webcam model. Born and raised in Lebanon, she and her family relocated to the United States in 2001. She entered the sex industry in October 2014, becoming the most viewed performer on Pornhub in two months. Her career choice was met with controversy after the release of a video in which she is engaged in a threesome while wearing a hijab; the scene brought Khalifa instant popularity as well as criticism from writers and religious figures. In 2015, Khalifa was voted the "Number 1 Porn Star" on Pornhub.[2] In January 2017, xHamster reported that she was the most-searched-for adult actress of 2016.[3] In 2018, she became the most-searched-for actress on Pornhub.[4]</p>

    Khalifa was born in Beirut, Lebanon[1] and raised Catholic in what she describes as a "very conservative" home.[5] She attended a French-language private school in Beirut, where she also learned to speak English.[5] Khalifa's family left their home in the wake of the South Lebanon conflict,[1][5] moving to the United States in 2001.[6]

After moving to the United States, her family lived in Montgomery County, Maryland,[5][6] where she played lacrosse in high school.[7] She has said she was bullied at school for being "the darkest and weirdest girl there", which intensified after the September 11

    <p>Pornographic film career
        Khalifa entered the pornographic film industry in October 2014, after being recruited by a man who asked her if she was interested in nude modeling.[9][10] Her stage name was taken from the name of her dog, Mia, and American rapper Wiz Khalifa.[11]
        
        She came to widespread attention after the release of a scene from Bang Bros in which she wears a hijab during a threesome.[5] The scene brought Khalifa instant popularity, as well as criticism from writers and religious figures, and led to her parents publicly disowning her.[5][12] Alex Hawkins, vice president of marketing for xHamster, said, "The outrage it caused in the Arab world ended up being a bit of a 'Streisand effect'. Suddenly, everyone was searching for her.</p>

      <p>On December 28, 2018, Pornhub revealed that she was the No. 1 ranked performer on their website.[4] After becoming the most searched-for actress on Pornhub, Khalifa received online death threats, including a manipulated image of Khalifa being held captive by an Islamic State executioner and a warning that she would be "the first person in Hellfire",[13] to which she jokingly replied, "I've been meaning to get a little tan recently."[14] Lebanese newspapers wrote articles critical of Khalifa, which she considered trivial due to other events in the region.</p>

        <p> In an interview with The Washington Post, Khalifa said the controversial scene was satirical and should be taken as such, claiming that Hollywood films depicted Muslims in a far more negative light than any pornographer could.[14] Among those who publicly spoke out to defend her decision to become an adult performer was British-Lebanese author Nasri Atallah, who stated, "The moral indignation ... is wrong for two reasons. First and foremost, as a woman, she is free to do as she pleases with her body. As a sentient human being with agency, who lives halfway across the world, she is in charge of her own life and owes absolutely nothing to the cou</p>

            According to data from Pornhub, from January 3 to 6, 2015, searches for Khalifa increased five-fold. Around a quarter of those searches came from Lebanon, with substantial searches also from nearby countries Syria and Jordan.[16] Almaza, a Lebanese brewery, ran an advertisement showing a bottle of their beer next to Khalifa's signature glasses

        <p>n January 2015, Khalifa signed a long-term contract with Bang Bros' parent company, WGCZ Holding, who also own the largest free porn site XVideos. The contract required her to perform in multiple films each month. However, two weeks later, Khalifa had a change of heart and resigned.[5] The negative attention she received from her global attention prompted her to leave the industry: "It was an eye-opener for me. I don't want any of this, whether it's positive or negative—but all of it was negative. I didn't think too much into it about how my friends and family and relationships were suffering."[5] WGCZ Holding own a web page with a domain name using her stage name. Khalifa said it does not pay her for rights, even though it is written in her first-person voice.[19]</p>
